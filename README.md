# DynamicBranchPredictors
HDL Implementation of Dynamic Branch Predictors

## Overview
Branches in programs have the potential to be a major source of poor performance in a system. Branch prediction is a way to avoid these poor performance pitfalls by preemptively loading instructions following a branch according to some prediction scheme. Dynamic branch prediction describes a branch prediction scheme that changes the prediction, either branch taken or branch not taken, based on some previous data. This project explores three different types of dynamic branch prediction schemes: 1-bit, 2-bit, and (3,2) correlating predictors. These predictors were built from scratch using VHDL hardware description language and simulated using [ModelSim](https://eda.sw.siemens.com/en-US/ic/modelsim/) software. In order to achieve this, the prediction concepts had to be converted to hardware devices that would perform the function necessary for each prediction scheme. This was done with mux, counters, and shift register devices. Test bench programs were written in VHDL to test the prediction schemes for correctness and performance. The branches of a simple nested for loop algorithm were recorded to a .txt file using python.
